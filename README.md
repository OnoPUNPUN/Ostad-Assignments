# Vehicle Assignment

## Assignment Details

This repository contains the solution for the Vehicle assignment as per the given requirements.

### Requirements:

#### a) Create an abstract class `Vehicle` with:
- A protected variable `_speed`.
- An abstract method `move()`.
- A non-abstract method `setSpeed(int speed)` to set the speed.

#### b) Create a subclass `Car` that extends `Vehicle`:
- Implement the `move()` method to print: 
  ```
  The car is moving at $_speed km/h.
  ```

#### c) Use encapsulation:
- Prevent direct access to `_speed`.

#### d) In the main function:
- Create an object of `Car`.
- Set the speed.
- Call the `move()` method.
